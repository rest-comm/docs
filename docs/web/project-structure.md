# Understanding Project Structure

The `Web` project structure follows a domain-driven concept as listed in the [Bulletproof React](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react/blob/master/docs/project-structure.md). To summarise, the `features` folders will consist of domain specific `feature` that contain components, hooks, logics, utils, etc specific to that `feature`. Files and folders outside the `features` folder will mainly be used as common/global components, hooks, logics, utils, etc.
